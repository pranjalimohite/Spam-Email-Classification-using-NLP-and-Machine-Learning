# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
<h3>This project classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. By preprocessing email text data and applying ML algorithms, we can build a model that accurately detects spam emails.
Spam email detection is a common NLP application that improves communication security and email filtering for end-users.</h3>
